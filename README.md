# kilowatts open source, live balancing market app
This first-of-its kind, open source React Native app (for web and ios/android) provides live, second-by-second information on the output of different generators on the UK grid. 

# Help wanted

We need help improving our list of generators displayed in the app. In particular, we need:

1. Help giving user-friendly names instead of Elexon codes (like `T-LAGA-1`)
2. Help grouping individual units of power stations (like Hornsea 1 and 2) so that they are grouped together
3. Help locating them on a map with lat/lng coordinates for a (TBC) awesome new map view that we're working on


# Data Attribution
All data in this app is sourced from the wonderful Elexon insights API `https://bmrs.elexon.co.uk/api-documentation`. Many thanks to the awesome team there for their continued hard work.
